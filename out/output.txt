 O Russia!
 thou, my Svetlana!
 Remember the retort satiric!
 but Olga would have never read!
 the impatient conqueror was humbled!
 and saved from being charmed or fooled!
 The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
 reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
 would have been all that we required!
 whom thirty centuries have adored!
 the silence when our talk had ceased!
 of swaddling clothes - already blighted!
 So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
 and been as happy... as I could!
 have reunited friend to friend!
 the poet struck down by his friend!
 Farewell the games of golden childhood!
 your presence aches, and in my blood!
 your advent swamps me in its flood!
 and pale, and fade without a word!
 in rural calm's most secret place!
 your night of fretting's left no trace!
 he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
 gay nature and its sparkling distance!
 Farewell to you, my free existence!
 breakneck by moonlight at my side!
 all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
 that your proud glance is sure to take!
 how well she'd studied her new role!
 Let others learn from his example!
 misunderstanding, noise, and blame!
 the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
 Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
 for unmeant kindness - how he shone!
 the country's pretty stupid here!
 is all those stubborn lips desire!
 of Olga: love's that kind of bore!
 your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
 impart such lessons as you please!
 my declaration may give rise!
 come to the fields, my friends! To horse!
 the toll of those borne off by fate!
 but madrigals I've got to write!
 already high in treason's league!
 A sorry state of things, it's true!
 what wings our first successes gave!
 bestirred himself, was devilish active!
 What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
 of solitude, and peace abiding!
 ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
 how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
 his news has set the party humming!
 She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
 I love my Tatyana too much!
 of perfect bliss in you. Enough!
 in triumph you'll see winter through!
 God grant them years and years of health!
 take leave of my lightheaded youth!
 so much, I'm left no time to speak!
 blest is the advent of the dark!
 Muse of the epic, bless my work!
 you made me drunk as one could ask!
 who else? - the hero of our novel!
 of husband's friendship - worst of all!
 the Lord have mercy on us all!
 sits there beside the window-sill!
 ever so roughly rocked my soul!
 or seminarist in yellow shawl!
 the fear and rage with which I foam!
 a Lancer - how she deified him!
 so, if we want to change, we can!
 harboured by maidens of thirteen!
 On this we'll part; goodbye again!
 he loves you... like your kith and kin!
 her secret work of magic suasion!
 she wrote in French... what a confession!
 In Tanya, what a transformation!
 of his Och&aacute;kov7 decoration!
 What folly! and what retribution!
 ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
 the laurel in the old man's crown!
 sacred to children of Apollo!
 and human words, and horse's stamp!
 ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
 with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
 my last poor lepton for a sup!
 how brilliant with its instant tear!
 your loved one, honourable reader!
 Enough. The load is off my shoulder!
 ``You pile one eclogue on another!
 Drive on, Andryushka! quicker, quicker!
 he fled from their resounding chatter!
 Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!
 exists for me one special pair!
 one customary grief each hour!
 on this unstable life, my friends!
 her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
 you object of my guileless ditties!
 its views, its passions, or its cares!
 to lie down at her feet like slaves!
 stripping my soul before your eyes!
 stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!
 for jokes, and rows, and merry dreams!
 and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!
 farewell you too, familiar mountains!
 Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
 Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
 in that one sound, for Russian hearts!
 what store of riches it imparts!
 but from our friends, good Lord protect us!
 the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
 O rus!
 as the perfection of our days!
 of absence on my wandering ways!
 in which, dear friends, we're all afloat!
 I ask you, each and every poet!
 and then concludes: she loves him yet!
 last many a day, and many a night!
 you gave me such a shocking fright!
 or else... or else, may God forfend it!
 with censure - I've done all to earn it!
 no spark of fun in all its rot!
 and self-oblivion was his art!
 wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
 in all the world could take my heart!
 the heart of the professional flirt!
 A ball: the joy of every guest!
 you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
 You husbands, deeply I respect you!
 long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!
 jointly would tread life's humble way!
 I've wasted too much life away!
 and never stir a foot away!
 Why, pretty one, you're up already!
 have your fill of revelry!
 Only the ode, that solemn story!
 But onward, onward with my story!
 He rings at once, and what a scurry!
 Capricious belles of grand Society!
 Take Olga's shoulders now - the beauty!
 ``Princess, mon ange!'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''
 ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''
 ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
 down in our damp earth-mother's womb!''
 he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
 ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
 beloved friend, thou art my bride!''
 ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
 ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''
 come in and warm yourself a minute!''
 and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
 ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
 ``To...?'' ``Larina.'' ``Tatyana? never!''
 Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''
 Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
 sing about something else at last!''
 young poet, be for ever blest!''
 ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''
 ``My goodness, how the years do fly!''
 "When will the devil come for you?"''
 ``Tanya's no child - it's past a joke,''
 ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
 I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
 kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''
 She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
 give me the homely hearth, and lend...''
 with every different kind of rabble...''
 and not a mention of my name...''
 but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''
 ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
 times were, when master's least suggestion...''
 The olden days, I want to hear...''
 from deepest backwood, furthest under...''
 Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
 but whispers, the guffaw of fools...''
 while odes have high and noble aims...''
 you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
 too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
 the poet's only theme is ``I.''

 a monster of the gens Satanic,
 Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
 Through the tight ranks - aristocratic,
 But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
 themes popular or idealistic,
 from threads both sad and humoristic,
 the elegy, grown paralytic,
 boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
 The horses, as they sense the dead,
 The happiness of youth is dead,
 with storm and tumult in his head,
 in friendly gatherings where I read,
 and for belle Nina, as it read,
 on which a carpet has been spread,
 tries out the ice with cautious tread,
 But that's enough. At once, in stead,
 but now grown plain and kind in stead,
 one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
 At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
 Tatyana simply lay in bed,
 on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
 in sultry sleep, in lonely bed,
 where admonitions are pronounced,
 where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
 loved someone else, not her intended,
 ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
 In the two sisters' rooms extended,
 amongst the crafty and small-minded,
 Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
 in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
 Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
 but in an earlier age retarded,
 Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
 touches obliquely, but with speed,
 the draught whose blessings are agreed,
 midst crones with endless tears to shed,
 ``Whither, oh whither are ye banished,
 Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
 have other maidens, since you vanished,
 my little feet, where have you vanished,
 that table where the lamp has languished,
 his nature would be changed and steadied,
 people there were he glorified,
 but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
 and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
 the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
 Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
 the samovar of evening boiled,
 enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,
 Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
 His hair was fashionably curled,
 hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
 he watched the guests and, as he dined,
 in quilted dressing-gown adorned,
 and in the country, blissful, horned,
 her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
 as something not to be declared,
 on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
 at twenty, was a fop inbred,
 Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
 however much her soul has faltered,
 The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
 I don't mean that she never shivered,
 no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
 he almost lost his mind, expired,
 threw Eugene at her feet - she stirred,
 it was that he'd been truly stirred,
 deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
 she brought her talents, never ceased,
 hold half the world still unreleased,
 when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
 of inexperience would have passed,
 Unforced, as conversation passed,
 she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
 is in voluptuous languor dressed,
 Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
 struck down as if she'd been accused,
 He thought that Olga'd be confused,
 to whom your hearts are dedicated,
 and Fly&aacute;nov, amply lubricated,
 its nullity I've always hated,
 by all is sweetly mutilated,
 on waves of far niente floated,
 Seeing Vladimir had defected,
 The tomcat, mannered and affected,
 a bit provincial and affected,
 his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
 He sang of love, to love subjected,
 which held him silently subjected,
 she'd never join the game selected,
 a park, enormous and neglected,
 around Priam the much-respected,
 However closely he inspected,
 they find her somewhat unexpected,
 and the churchyard where, new-erected,
 of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,
 now, by green tablecloths awaited,
 Where is the fire that once ignited,
 Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
 Sometimes a landscape's represented,
 a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
 Between the lines of text as printed,
 To harmless idleness devoted,
 From that rough spell at last exempted,
 treaties of nations long departed,
 at earliest morning out she started,
 of this our novel we reported,
 And long, as if through mists that spurted,
 with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
 and happy licence are allowed,
 by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,
 Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
 after the martyr's price it paid,
 So my Zaretsky, as I said,
 this Grandison of hers was splendid,
 Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
 on springtime grasses of the field,
 under the table's linen shield,
 Boston and ombre for the old,
 ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
 had made his name, when, bold as bold,
 the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
 Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
 We each have enemies in this world,
 ditties of our secret world,
 ditty of our secret world,
 in manifesting, as he could,
 spying my features, as he could,
 of calculated slander should,
 to the princess, in his weak hand,
 now warmth and blossom are on hand,
 a Lancer wooed and won her hand,
 put a strong staff into my hand,
 in front of you, on every hand,
 sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
 long, lively tales from wonderland,
 a true companion to the end,
 we weep for the young lover's end,
 whoever you may be, a friend,
 But don't be cross, my darling friend,
 Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
 if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
 still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
 he leaves a tender verse behind,
 his tea with rum quite left behind,
 cold, pure as ice, and as unkind,
 with pots and basins out of mind,
 your Tanya's image in your mind,
 ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
 and also prettier, I'll be bound,
 she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
 though there he's no more to be found,
 a corpse on boards was all he found,
 I'll make them spar another round,
 by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
 and the poet, without a sound,
 his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
 frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
 She hates a friendly voice's sound,
 and listen for the heart's first sound,
 honest devotion to the good,
 as gage of all things that were good,
 of leaves that autumn killed for good,
 she guards, in silence and for good,
 And then she broods and mopes for good,
 fancy, a wine serene in mood,
 he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
 perfervid language of the bard,
 which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
 condemned to a lifetime of hard,
 and dead ideas from that old hoard,
 Eugene attends the boulevard,
 as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
 and looked at him without a word,
 of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
 Melpomene wails long and loud,
 before a cold, indifferent crowd,
 But ours, whatever he might be,
 swam on the river's dreaming face,
 into the all&eacute;e, face to face,
 of our first meeting face to face,
 did any glasses seek her face,
 has made the park her brooding-place,
 from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,
 in through the door, at swallow's pace,
 each took four steps across the space,
 alone across the fields of space,
 she speeds her footsteps to a race,
 a soul of sympathy and grace,
 and then, with an enchanting grace,
 of recompense beyond endurance,
 Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
 with irresistible refulgence,
 raised a dull eye to moon's refulgence,
 now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
 An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
 here's boredom, madness or pretence,
 Without romance, or false insistence,
 as helpmeet in my sad existence,
 From his first youth he'd known the force,
 for him a lofty stair. His shade,
 just now of wrestling with his shade,
 the coolness of the sombre glade,
 &lt; amongst the soulless men of pride,
 she sits down calmly on one side,
 the new moon, horned, on her left side,
 Friend of my heart, be at my side,
 perfidious blow to my inside,
 And now the door is opened wide,
 now sensitive, and now carefree,
 each springtime, on the growing tree,
 Onegin too - and there to see,
 at first, with God knows whom to see,
 Now here's a letter, as you see,
 the peaceful Muses' devotee,
 the climacteric of our life,
 always contented with his life,
 where civil treacheries are rife,
 the lies that in the press run rife,
 his children and his faithful wife,
 and with no post, no work, no wife,
 are bound, by every virtuous wife,
 has found a port for his old age,
 good-looking, in the flower of age,
 all this, at eighteen years of age,
 that nubile maid of riper age,
 are entered here, in friendship's gage,
 mountains are piled on every carriage,
 the solitude of woods and tillage,
 He's gone away and left his village,
 and lives, a veritable sage,
 as was the old suspicious sage,
 of their society turned her savage,
 where he was master of his college,
 through baseness of the soul that he,
 Was it to no effect that he,
 took her to his estate, where she,
 death on his brow, your friend should lie,
 Five versts or so from Krasnog&oacute;rie,
 that soul without a moral tie,
 a rambling walk beside my lake,
 on tragedy; but it's no joke,
 just at this crisis of his gale,
 in question, gossip, news and tale,
 the leather rein, to learn the tale,
 value the hero of my tale,
 But from the hero of my tale,
 in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
 ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
 a skeleton jerked by a cable,
 Prepared for prophecy and fable,
 a grammar, a digest of fable,
 to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
 two cupboards, one divan, a table,
 a group of monsters round a table,
 the iron figure3 on the table,
 Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
 cooked-up where garret-vermin babble,
 endorsed by fashionable rabble,
 When out to burst a rival's bubble,
 or cause the bursting of his bubble,
 How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
 of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,
 Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
 Then in return for all this twaddle,
 a steed responsive to the bridle,
 Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
 bored by success' giddy trifle,
 not even by chance, once in a while,
 he even dares, once in a while,
 will the benighted reason smile,
 emboldened by his Olga's smile,
 his virulence that made you smile,
 scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
 fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
 The hall is full of noise and hustle,
 for dreams, or journalistic battle,
 would cause widespread remark and tattle,
 and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
 And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
 dons of Epicurean rule,
 he killed eight years in such a style,
 unnoticed, in unseeing style,
 young Tanya first appeared to me,
 He destined Olga's hand for me,
 I've no one here who comprehends me,
 and now a swooning mind attends me,
 an old man saw her as she came,
 that there be just one voice which came,
 become a joke to us, its game,
 you'd not so much as know the name,
 though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
 while men, all sombre, all the same,
 the hapless Phrygians all the same,
 freezes my blood... Yet all the same,
 and part in kindness? Just the same,
 felicitously every theme,
 summits of aspen, birch and lime,
 no beauties of a foreign clime,
 she won't inhale the powdered rime,
 the horror of disgrace and crime,
 Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
 youthful, who ripened in his time,
 where are the reveries this time,
 He sang of grief and parting-time,
 for her, no joy from winter-time,
 pointed each year, for time to come,
 to me her best in-quarto tome,
 love's melting dreams shall fill my rhyme,
 Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
 of powers unripe, or on the wane,
 that king of the satiric scene,
 Olga's appeared upon the scene,
 and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
 of whispering woods where my Eugene,
 moved and surprised, she stays serene,
 left her to follow her own line,
 Tatyana, lonely heroine,
 in secret judgement what he'd done,
 with work at home; but when he'd gone,
 of the whole world, her nurse alone,
 in deepest grasses, quite alone,
 ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,
 are coloured in a single tone,
 of modish belles the modish foe,
 I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
 her darling foot of its wet shoe,
 From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
 right in the flower of joyous hope,
 Just let yourself be your whole care,
 and Grandison beyond compare,
 Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;, the mediocre,
 closely embraced, in wending here,
 beneath the stone reposes here,
 her drops of tears, and seated there,
 and where's her sister now? and where,
 its own perfection everywhere,
 to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
 and found her dreams, her secret fire,
 is either the distrait Vampire,
 to hear what latest modes require,
 their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
 From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
 by moonlight two young girls took pleasure,
 thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
 But in misfortune or displeasure,
 And then, to part us in full measure,
 the secret of her husband's measure,
 so it was not in any measure,
 Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
 O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
 time was, in evening hours of leisure,
 she found, in labours and in leisure,
 it touched with reverie her leisure,
 she calls down curses on their leisure,
 that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
 And so, at last, feature by feature,
 the hall's without a living creature,
 it's also true, in battle's rapture,
 some vote a doctor for the case,
 his pistols, laid them in their case,
 then afterwards, alone, at ease,
 her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
 with heart that's grown unused to praise,
 gentlemanly, quite precise,
 have vanished, like an empty noise,
 smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
 or, with an epigram-surprise,
 no matter: hope, in child's disguise,
 prepares himself; and then his verse,
 of oligarchical converse,
 compact of amorous trash, and worse,
 so, cursing women's devious course,
 within her bosom to abate,
 for you have, at this early date,
 looked down in an access of hate,
 in loaded carriages, migrate,
 to fashion's absolute dictate,
 of pity for my wretched state,
 He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
 of plains where boredom reigns complete,
 here a weak version, incomplete,
 the murmuring Nereids recite,
 roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
 a patriot, a cosmopolite,
 proficiency to speak and write,
 a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
 that's the morass, I beg you note,
 still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
 yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
 and set on hating the coquette,
 stood in the door, cherubic, mute,
 on billiard-table rests a cue,
 already studying to intrigue,
 unhesitating from her tongue,
 to cool my glances and my tongue,
 of a provincial ing&eacute;nue,
 ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
 am always glad to write, it's true,
 this very day I'd gladly give,
 the glare, the fumes in which I live,
 Such feckless passion - as I live,
 whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
 not cold, but also not effusive,
 she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
 he found Tatyana so attractive,
 what can one do? as said above,
 vexation? vainness? heavens above,
 frightened to death a timid love,
 recalling earlier loves, did we,
 to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
 homestead, before her parents' gaze,
 arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
 looks at him with a steady gaze,
 we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
 her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
 and all into the salon squeeze,
 each moral puts us in a doze,
 The ploughman there delights to doze,
 she once had pined in girlish grief,
 yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
 at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
 and took two Petriads in calf,
 he charged three roubles and a half,
 he never took one from the shelf,
 odd volumes from the devil's shelf,
 is forced to crucify himself,
 a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
 the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
 How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
 to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
 What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
 the barbs that envy's always spreading,
 what's in them? All this loud parading,
 and all this flashy masquerading,
 that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
 he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
 he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
 They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
 On the seashore, with storm impending,
 ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
 has voices that are more resounding,
 Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
 the utter virtue of their being,
 in the expression of its being,
 but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,
 a word or two, or stare unseeing,
 In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
 she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
 and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
 its echoes, its belated urging,
 its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
 to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,
 he had conveyed some moral teaching,
 our troikas effortlessly dashing,
 Then our Automedons are flashing,
 Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,
 but wildly still her heart is rushing,
 Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
 Elbow on table, spirit seething,
 the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
 and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,
 his life till dawn's already making,
 over the business of leave-taking,
 Next day Tatyana, early waking,
 ``oh, quit your stale, your tedious quacking,
 spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
 incendiary looks are slinking,
 Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
 that, artless, and without concealing,
 The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
 fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
 as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
 Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
 her love obeys the laws of feeling,
 allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
 hate, love, joy, sorrow - every feeling,
 Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
 just sentries to each other calling,
 tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
 now ten has struck, his wheels are rolling,
 Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
 Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
 it's easy, without too much fooling,
 to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
 lickspittles who adore their crawling,
 stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,
 one customary object gleaming,
 how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
 embodied by the power of dreaming,
 perpetually, one goal for dreaming,
 and everything around was dreaming,
 before a fire too slowly flaming,
 started a life of pointless roaming,
 These figures from the world of seeming,
 and duck get up; with instant timing,
 the regimental band is coming,
 as all things did, to bore him; homing,
 He could have spoken without harming,
 when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
 and, on my bed-head gently leaning,
 with love and comfort in your meaning,
 my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
 ``The morning star will soon be shining,
 I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
 and so, before the world of learning,
 devoted to the Muse, or learning,
 the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
 you drink the magic draught of yearning,
 and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
 into the fields, surveys the morning,
 pinker than glow of Northern morning,
 whisper of breeze announces morning,
 would settle, on the morrow morning,
 a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
 one day came down that lonely turning,
 no years of absence past returning,
 Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
 for which of them the tomb was yawning,
 the level tenor of his going,
 ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
 as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
 is softly, indolently sleeping,
 on my untimely urn be weeping,
 Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
 There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
 hunts cheeky flies, with swatter sweeping,
 the audience still is busy stamping,
 Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
 from off her charming shoulder's drooping,
 up your accounts, and raging, toping,
 ignores approval's friendly clapping,
 and where Thalia, gently napping,
 great bard despite his modest trapping,
 into the pan. Securely gripping,
 and though to do so would be daring,
 before you on the ground, unhearing,
 if, motionless, no life appearing,
 Petushk&oacute;v, local Paris, tearing,
 Elated by the music's blaring,
 scarlet with passion's instant flaring,
 or else does nature, fresh and staring,
 that's the refrain that you should sing,
 So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
 no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
 in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
 Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
 they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
 The years incline to gloom and prosing,
 new guest is gradually progressing,
 admires the tumult and the pressing,
 I longed, like every breaker hissing,
 ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
 while Petersburg's already rousing,
 or if himself, with rage arousing,
 some nonsense thrown up while carousing,
 And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
 She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
 Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
 in you a tender pulse was beating,
 we'll keep love's price appreciating,
 The house is packed out; scintillating,
 reader, we must be separating,
 and thus our race, so fluctuating,
 light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,
 ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
 that lady the hostess was greeting,
 there never fails a kindly greeting,
 Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
 flows and reverberates. Reciting,
 Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
 untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
 Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
 he who has cooled down love with parting,
 the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
 the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
 That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
 ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
 then in the study's quiet setting,
 his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
 she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
 there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
 while serious topics were disputing,
 Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
 then, country evening fast arriving,
 as files, and scissors straight and curving,
 the answer's past all human viewing,
 and when its waters were not showing,
 and band already tired of blowing,
 The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
 Day faded; on the table, glowing,
 How often, when the sky was glowing,
 once, with its foaming and its playing,
 No one will think that worth gainsaying,
 Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
 So went his sermon. Almost dying,
 And yet, although it's past conveying,
 By now the shades of night are flying,
 to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
 through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
 soon, infidelity proved cloying,
 else, having found his pleasure cloying,
 secluded vales, where swans were crying,
 The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
 Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
 to talk as if with heart unwrung,
 so sketchily possessed by each,
 in my petition an approach,
 his humbly suppliant approach,
 the flickering tones of dress and speech,
 is it not true that Russian speech,
 now pay attention, I beseech,
 so that all three went off to lunch,
 set the guests smiling at his arch,
 with foppery and too much starch,
 a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
 no vulgar epigram too much,
 there's no absurdity as such,
 along the Neva in a sleigh,
 my Africa,18 where waves break high,
 were picking berries from the bough,
 with deep emotion through and through,
 so pure, so spotless through and through,
 Sbogar,8 mysterious through and through,
 and scorned his fellows through and through,
 and to Tanya, when he was through,
 the meaning of an epigraph,
 Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
 there's nothing can employ her anguish,
 Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
 Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
 suddenly lowering eyes that languish,
 of waiting for the dawn to blush,
 fieldwork directed from the path,
 an eloquence of fevered strength,
 fragments of poems from the North,
 fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,
 verdicts of vanity the bleak,
 but all concurred that, truth to speak,
 none listens when the others speak,
 is agony, if I may speak,
 men's thoughts, their plots, the words they speak,
 to pass for an affected freak,
 the other, jugs of applejack,
 avert his chest from pistol's click,
 but when past joking he fell sick,
 Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
 but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
 grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,
 By dire presentiment awestruck,
 the flaming roses of a cheek,
 behind the mill. In solemn talk,
 I move in the grand monde? that rank,
 their guests, for all they ate and drank,
 where you were born as well, I think,
 Ladies of such a cast, I think,
 at hours, which, why I cannot think,
 and bred upon the Neva's brink,
 So now be off to Neva's brink,
 parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
 the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
 he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
 terse words or crosses in the book,
 in father's or old uncle's book,
 with lively and pellucid look,
 sad meditations in her look,
 And just here, in the window-nook,
 where flows a little glittering brook,
 then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
 coldness of wit; each note he took,
 for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
 blessed are daytime's care and cark,
 Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
 a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
 with draughts from love's enticing flask,
 over the modish word ideal,
 goodbye to you, my true ideal,
 the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
 a novel, vague and superficial,
 over his neighbour's plain memorial,
 But let's return to our essential,
 his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
 But he could draw a joking moral,
 so heartless and so detrimental,
 she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
 and the majestic, antlered royal,
 while floors would split from crash of heel,
 or cunningly create a quarrel,
 Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
 No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
 Now, faced with this enormous revel,
 dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
 lift up the gauzes of her veil,
 wishes his madness to the devil,
 installed in me a different devil,
 the art he'd studied best of all,
 ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
 we'd better hasten to the ball,
 on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
 the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
 brigade of liveries in the hall,
 they all have swarmed into the hall,
 moonscape, the half-light overall,
 Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
 whether from heaven or from hell,
 although it's nearly heard the knell,
 my friends, I need to pause a spell,
 beauty with all its heavenly spell,
 this angel, this proud devil, tell,
 and breeding ducks and geese as well,
 spectacled age divines as well,
 Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
 Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
 without an elegiac frill,
 such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
 Often she halts against her will,
 is he who's never felt its will,
 the world's &eacute;clat, its thunder-roll,
 Public opinion - here's our idol,
 graduates of the Levshin1 school,
 past all the assembly in a whirl,
 Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
 for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,
 The years would pass; no longer youthful,
 Perhaps however, to be truthful,
 wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
 a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
 Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
 he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
 Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
 oppressed by emptiness of soul,
 left quite alone with his own soul,
 he's first to toast her in the bowl,
 impatiently on the mill-dam,
 some other, older spring will gleam,
 in midst of a poetic dream,
 freedom's enthusiastic dream,
 another, a more chilling dream,
 the magic voices of your stream,
 retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
 dean of Chaldea's learned team,
 from German realms of mist and steam,
 some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
 hereditary foes they seem,
 Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
 With womankind, the less we love them,
 a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
 It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
 how they remind me of your stem,
 Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
 at length, midst children swarming round him,
 At home she'll equably receive him,
 But she refuses to perceive him,
 dared clean his nails in front of him,
 he's a freemason too; for him,
 cherries then we'll throw at him,
 a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
 a nightingale, in forest gloom,
 across the plain's enormous room,
 the easier they become to charm,
 ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
 Semy&oacute;n Petr&oacute;vich, mean and glum,
 epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,
 They should be forced to read in Russian,
 So a disabled soldier-man,
 for her improvement, a roman,
 The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
 without surprise or rage... his laden,
 and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
 her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
 Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
 Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
 the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
 she sees it all. The simple maiden,
 return an answer, blunt or keen,
 use cunning silence as a screen,
 so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
 and once forbidden fruit is seen,
 In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
 immortals picked by fate for when,
 ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
 A sledded coach, for years forsaken,
 the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
 of human friendship, holy men,
 and with a yawn took up his pen,
 by Baratynsky's3 wondrous pen,
 Martin Zad&eacute;ka was the siren,
 In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
 And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
 to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
 are here untouched by fashion's reign,
 drives home - and plunging deeper in,
 on liquor, and on hay brought in,
 When we draw a fellow in,
 was one who raged and raged again,
 after two minutes, off again,
 advantages of heart and brain,
 plunged in reflection's deepest train,
 a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
 something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
 days that are lost behind the curtain,
 No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
 for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,
 Oh, this could all be false and vain,
 He deemed, in general, letters vain,
 a deathless murmur from within,
 on kennels, and on kith and kin,
 surer than friendship or than kin,
 ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
 Buy&aacute;nov, my vivacious cousin,
 since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
 he saw no point in staying on,
 the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
 invariably, as time went on,
 on a fast stallion from the Don,
 In duels a pedantic don,
 I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
 they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
 no softball for the winds of fashion,
 But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
 amid the deadening joys of fashion,
 All this has now gone out of fashion,
 sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
 Already, in exultant fashion,
 of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
 How often, with her sweet communion,
 Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
 you acted well, that dread occasion,
 He reads to Olga on occasion,
 of moralistical persuasion,
 your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
 How dull are acting and evasion,
 thirty-two steps with great precision,
 which has recalled, without precision,
 Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
 which, listening with some condescension,
 He got so used to this immersion,
 He gave this figure - loved with passion,
 facing a belle I loved with passion,
 But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
 he's viewed the boxes without passion,
 to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
 Well, I must make a frank confession,
 As, lovingly, in his confession,
 I make magnanimous confession,
 At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
 Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,
 Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
 in Russian never found expression,
 before such candour of expression,
 the poet's heart found full expression,
 On these, with something like obsession,
 Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
 A thinker in a desert mission,
 pours out its guiltless frank admission,
 her discomposure, her confusion,
 and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
 an idle monk in glum seclusion,
 The manor house, in deep seclusion,
 What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
 He followed them without illusion,
 screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
 lost them without regret's contusion,
 at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
 Idle again by dedication,
 of Eugene, cold as all creation,
 the fleeting works of my creation,
 Evgeny, hating litigation,
 in indescribable elation,
 of philosophic isolation,
 so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
 alone, and sunk in calculation,
 Compassion, yes, and indignation,
 secure a secret assignation,
 and all our fresh imagination,
 I'll gladden your imagination,
 come, trouble my imagination,
 yet a capricious inclination,
 too long, against my inclination,
 then he'd implore a declaration,
 Bards of our tearful generation,
 by writers of her admiration,
 when our sublimest aspiration,
 where dwelt this child of inspiration,
 Fired by the god of inspiration,
 ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
 hear, once more filled with inspiration,
 field-work, and walks with inspiration,
 But come, thou youthful inspiration,
 bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
 Though belles had lost his adoration,
 with a blunt cue for the duration,
 it had no sparkle of sensation,
 Then gradually upon sensation,
 (I like a friendly conversation,
 no mannerism, no affectation,
 the strangeness of her habitation,
 trusted her without hesitation,
 where fate had fixed our confrontation,
 Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
 before the window taking station,
 With mounts from home, or postal station,
 is where old master took up station,
 The invalid's glad salutation,
 on words of foreign derivation,
 I pray God grant his soul salvation,
 what kind of thought, what observation,
 I thank him without reservation,
 with shelves of books deployed for action,
 The nervous-tragical reaction,
 by what's called machinal reaction,
 A pause of silence and inaction,
 He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
 Lensky all evening, in distraction,
 I grasp a stirrup with affection,
 I feel a brotherly affection,
 on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
 for him all sham has found rejection,
 I've drawn a plan and a projection,
 the man of reverie and reflection,
 what holds her in profound reflection,
 in simple but sublime reflection,
 almanacs, journals of reflection,
 Lending his tone a grave inflection,
 what held me was my predilection,
 He found them in some old collection,
 he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
 then on the leaves of recollection,
 you sought - tumultuous recollection,
 Poets, I'll say in this connection,
 but looks and talk took the direction,
 I trust my fate to your direction,
 Reader, whatever fate's direction,
 to undertake their resurrection,
 giving the lady their protection,
 there's far too much of contradiction,
 drink in the midnight benediction,
 in dreams and cards and their prediction,
 untouched by trace of inhibition,
 I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
 a joker in the old tradition,
 the guardian angel of tradition,
 a modish second-hand edition,
 the modesty of her condition,
 Tatyana, hiding her condition,
 Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
 those words where love, without condition,
 At this midnight of my condition,
 With spelling scrambled to perdition,
 His unexpected apparition,
 what is he? Just an apparition,
 was it not you, dear apparition,
 methodical by disposition,
 the first will never find fruition,
 at first Madame gave him tuition,
 and then it's tea that comes to mention,
 it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
 She's paid the sunrise no attention,
 Now, she devours, with what attention,
 devoured a book with rapt attention,
 he'll charm you with his fine invention,
 Deaf to her sister's intervention,
 She went - and Eugene, all emotion,
 your tears would flow - but your emotion,
 What sort of roses, in your notion,
 Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
 By dreams now sad in their conception,
 yet, as each rule has its exception,
 he almost begs for absolution,
 he looks, in sweet irresolution,
 that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
 a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
 young traitresses by the platoon,
 by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
 Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
 Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
 imagination, with such reason,
 Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
 so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
 He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
 no meaning in or out of season,
 By contrast, in the frozen season,
 a free romance's far horizon,
 my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
 something to fritter and to burn,
 products of carefree hours, of fun,
 for friends of languor, or of fun,
 last night he'd erred in making fun,
 one sees a duck and aims his gun,
 and soon his travels had begun,
 and paler than the moon at dawn,
 for Olga, on the spreading lawn,
 her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
 onset of the incipient yawn,
 her head in modesty cast down,
 and lovelorn maiden whom he'd known,
 and at the altar, with a crown,
 the shepherd, as he used to do,
 still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,
 where did that glum eccentric go,
 as fast as post-horses could go,
 ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
 glitter and tumble as they go,
 a soul that perished long ago,
 of language which, so long ago,
 in Lyc&eacute;e gardens long ago,
 or pine, persuade of yes or no,
 and how's Tatyana? Olga too,
 Onegin sits at table too,
 so pious, and so clever too,
 can chatter, and be silent too,
 punctilious in his cotton cap,
 and introduced, for the last lap,
 the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
 mountains will part; below the deep,
 Only Tatyana does not sleep,
 across each bush, across each steep,
 henceforth in front of you I weep,
 land where I learned to love and weep,
 taken the saucers in their grip,
 song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
 a plain, unceremonious troop,
 from thirty down to two; and stop,
 he arrives - the cork goes flying up,
 recall, by its bewitching cup,
 the joys of youth, that festal cup,
 their hand to grapple slander's cup,
 neighbours and friends in kindly group,
 Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
 sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
 unseen, already you were dear,
 Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
 by waters that were still and clear,
 my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
 as gay as morning and as clear,
 an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
 villages flickered far and near,
 when we see him from afar,
 complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
 ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
 Whether the arrow has my number,
 Back to his regiment the Lancer,
 Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
 in my long task, be my upholder,
 in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
 Who taught her an address so tender,
 My love for it is just as tender,
 that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
 the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
 ladies at the fireside confer,
 who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
 roamed the still forest like a ranger,
 by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,
 then know that your reproving finger,
 in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
 ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
 what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
 ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
 But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
 bound where the magic bow will send her,
 her heartache, did it long compel her,
 To my astonishment I've seen her,
 all day, all night, his presence fills her,
 Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
 the doorway opened wide to meet her,
 At once Anisia came to greet her,
 I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
 hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
 a joking flirt, or both together,
 And not because she'd read him, either,
 I would have found a friend, another,
 for God's sake, that will do. But, brother,
 long since, like brother linked to brother,
 and more than once the German baker,
 and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,
 who in the country spends her summer,
 He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
 and the young city-bred newcomer,
 Gvozd&iacute;n, exemplary farmer,
 Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
 but just to make the bargain keener,
 exercised, under lucre's banner,
 In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
 into the mud, a drunken goner,
 unswerving friend, correct landowner,
 Give me a pen and give me paper,
 she never read a Russian paper,
 of secrets, like a friend but dearer,
 was G&ouml;ttingen, his alma mater,
 of Neva's proud imperial water,
 I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
 What do I want? what am I after,
 Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
 like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
 between two aunts, in pillared shelter,
 panes patterned by the finest printer,
 pale transcript of a vivid master,
 Longtime inside this modish cloister,
 It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
 there was a general furtive chatter,
 No, incorrect and careless chatter,
 The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
 Their talk, so sound on every matter,
 evoke emotion's pitter-patter,
 Who could have looked the poet better,
 but brighter than the heavenly litter,
 The night has many stars that glitter,
 she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
 Fare thee well, and if for ever,
 Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
 so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
 that fell, and then began to shiver,
 led to the princess, all a-shiver,
 And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
 not once a day a thought will quiver,
 Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
 There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
 with brilliant conquests by the shower,
 his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
 not separation's chilling power,
 Lensky at home awaits the answer,
 he's at the club, a real stayer,
 her heart had spoken, free as air,
 the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
 a deft arrangement to his hair,
 they shove each plate, and every chair,
 no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
 but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
 To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
 Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
 or, after some dull dinner's labour,
 Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
 Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
 ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,
 whispers some ballad of the hour,
 my inept pupil, at that hour,
 Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
 he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
 like Regulus, that god of honour,
 her Russian was as thin as vapour,
 of the dull shores of my disfavour,
 to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
 in sledded coaches and coup&eacute;s,
 insists, when the mazurka ends,
 dear companions, darling friends,
 on most occasions between friends,
 I prize the attention of my friends,
 and by Repentance. All this lends,
 the total ownership of woods,
 a fop, a punter on the cards,
 although there are no streets, no cards,
 Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
 to all the most adored actrices,
 with bended knees a windmill dances,
 From early on she loved romances,
 recalling earlier time's romances,
 till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
 the prejudices of the ages,
 (vain twaddle, fables of the ages,
 with broods of children of all ages,
 as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
 and feather-beds, and birds in cages,
 a blessing from its blasts and rages,
 There's din of parting now that rages,
 and the Skot&iacute;nins, grizzled sages,
 Priam-like agricultural sages,
 parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,
 peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,
 a rest from toil and all its aches,
 upon her lips the breathing dies,
 and other, more exacting worries,
 resigned himself to prison's ties,
 Of course, the love of tender beauties,
 that generations of new beauties,
 will loyally discharge its duties,
 or just grammatical mistakes,
 the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
 for whom, to expiate your crimes,
 you've made so many secret rhymes,
 But friendship, as between our heroes,
 to comfort her in all her woes,
 The crush, the heat, as music blares,
 and jam in jars, and household wares,
 across the drift-encumbered acres,
 and force that purity inspires,
 calm men with beatific features,
 It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
 Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
 twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
 but then a sudden breeze surprises,
 frightening with all despair's disguises,
 inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
 the inevitable silly asses,
 Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
 High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
 Each others' and their own successes,
 the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
 the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
 the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
 round Tanya congregate the misses,
 Along the fronts of darkened houses,
 Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
 along the street where slumber drowses,
 critics and their capricious vogues,
 among the maidens and the wives,
 I find no sense; the truth is this,
 Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
 boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
 haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
 nonsense will earn indulgent looks,
 And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
 into the tomb's wide open portals,
 the country cottages and hovels,
 the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
 the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
 boys, country women, stately halls,
 and hetman of the gambling-halls,
 Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
 so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
 and life celestial's phantom gleams,
 Russia's old glories and their gleams,
 O, never know these frightful dreams,
 your soul displays, in holy dreams,
 empty the purpose it proclaims,
 in dream toward the woods and plains,
 the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
 it led him, in these early sessions,
 Alone amid all his possessions,
 a book of household calculations,
 of reason's icy intimations,
 the safest place for declarations,
 In days of carefree aspirations,
 of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
 Legends, and mystical traditions,
 No secret crimes, and no perditions,
 rumours and threats and premonitions,
 old prejudice; all men are zeros,
 its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
 beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,
 that lives, and glitters, and endears,
 threats, vows, and simulated fears,
 by six-page letters, rings and tears,
 I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
 lorgnettes of jealous fashion-leaders,
 to happen long ago, dear readers,
 am I estranged, does all that cheers,
 the morning light no longer lingers,
 passion's rough language talked by others,
 retired, forgotten by his brothers,
 a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
 Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
 they're all chained up in different fetters,
 He'd given up girls - now gave up letters,
 pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,
 flicker of swiftly twirling pairs,
 a fashion-plate for illustrators,
 another of the ball-dictators,
 he rested - wept for by his neighbours,
 still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
 he'll spend before the looking-glass,
 no proud pretentions to success,
 and from the salon the princess,
 gazes at him... and nonetheless,
 a shadow, null and meaningless,
 the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
 These days I'm finding even gladness,
 the atmosphere of youth and madness,
 Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
 I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
 Full of obedience and demureness,
 poetic in her simple pureness,
 Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
 stalking the momentary weakness,
 There, with epigrammatic neatness,
 against the tea's excessive sweetness,
 a Muscovite in Harold's dress,
 Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
 an elegy to her address,
 no haughty stare around the press,
 to play with a dishevelled tress,
 tracked him, and put him in duress,
 Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
 she spins and, friend of winter nights,
 its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
 But when a later age has found us,
 as when chill autumn rains surround us,
 even in novels, vice entraps us,
 Today a mental fog enwraps us,
 by dull eternity's purlieus,
 for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
 He was the slave of a tenacious,
 Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
 and though my muse may be capricious,
 too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
 However has he earned so vicious,
 your heroes, raging and ferocious,
 your battles, lawless and atrocious,
 And what's more, they're so supercilious,
 so circumspect, and so punctilious,
 and act the humble or imperious,
 And my companion, so mysterious,
 eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,
 (an attribute that's quite vexatious,
 attract the sneering of the jealous,
 as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
 its newness with our faded days,
 ``No, every minute of my days,
 The comrade of so many days,
 and on her cheeks the fever stays,
 yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
 such shadowy and leisured ways,
 But he, by sad and rocky ways,
 for dance, and din, and worldly ways,
 oblivion of life's stormy ways,
 thank you for suffering and its joys,
 From widow Clicquot and from Mo&euml;t,
 who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
 came driving to his country seat,
 fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
 it held me captive; tit for tat,
 in the salon new faces meet,
 is it that she, poor simple sweet,
 or of Ist&oacute;mina, my sweet,
 and enviable for a poet,
 no magic fancies of the poet,
 prince, who in that dark-red b&eacute;ret,
 youth which has nothing to regret,
 Already borne down by regret,
 and watch your daughters closer yet,
 blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
 her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
 get two young friends to pick a fight,
 in the mazurka he was light,
 he drives there like a bird in flight,
 with visions of enchanted night,
 solitude, stillness and the night,
 in the deep stillness of the night,
 in fashion's din, at still of night,
 by Neva, on a summer night,
 converting morning to midnight,
 have been a fool; yet he'd a right,
 saw through the window, morning-bright,
 once more, at that beloved sight,
 may chorus, when she comes in sight,
 should have been analysed when caught,
 one leads the multitude in thought,
 when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
 You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
 Alas, our youth was what we made it,
 there's a small window shining in it,
 Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
 but it's the first time you'll have known it,
 a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
 The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
 flown from society as we know it,
 In this, dear reader, if you know it,
 Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
 of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
 choruses, Tanya can but wait,
 with trees decked in their silvery kit,
 and jolly magpies on the flit,
 and good and ill, and learning's fruit,
 in his first dream of passion's fruit,
 on state affairs; there was a wit,
 full of his usual pith and wit,
 darkly above the water's lilt,
 What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
 before first light they have appointment,
 The rustic sage, in that apartment,
 Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
 its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
 his young heyday's supreme employment,
 But was it happy, his employment,
 and yet inseparably present,
 remains unmoved: still he's persistent,
 there, where the coulisse entrance went,
 poor girl, to drop into a faint,
 but will, and reason's strong constraint,
 and satisfied with what he'd got,
 of social buzz and modish riot,
 and, curious now about the lot,
 made over to them his whole lot,
 without a trace of spite or plot,
 by decent company, has not,
 I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
 and fastens, like a term of art,
 sharpness of wit, and social art,
 fly to my corner like a dart,
 it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
 the blood within my withered heart,
 they shared their days in deed and heart,
 with bursts of passion from the heart,
 as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
 one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
 Evgeny loved him from his heart,
 by my Eugene, not for his heart,
 in the far backwoods' deepest heart,
 liven the drowsing of my heart,
 your grief would fail to touch my heart,
 that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
 of jealousy has made her start,
 and to it, with a grave import,
 one finds in war amusing sport,
 dreams of inconsequential cast,
 she sits with head sunk on her breast,
 another's joy, another's breast,
 the hostess cries and, moving fast,
 drawn from a dim, warm-hearted past,
 whether it goes careering past,
 amusing, flattering with the best,
 startling the ingenuous with a jest,
 the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
 I put your genius to the test,
 down from the porch, light as the lightest,
 even by Ladies' Fashion Post,
 of her own horses, not the post,
 to pine away from passion's thirst,
 by will of Zeus, the high and just,
 Alas! the generations must,
 With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
 have pushed their frontiers further out,
 flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,
 his dreams, while she whom they're about,
 something to rack his brains about,
 at forty he'd have got the gout,
 throw meadows into muddy rout,
 drunk, eaten, yawned, grown weak and stout,
 now disenchanted with the next,
 more and more bored by yearning's text,
 devouring Gibbon and Rousseau,
 But now - oh God! - the thought of you,
 Friendship, as I must own to you,
 and counsellor (retired) Fly&aacute;nov,
 and look, my cousin's come, Buy&aacute;nov,
 and, still transparent to the view,
 Guillot, behind a stump in view,
 the pages of some dull review,
 as by the shortest way they flew,
 of pity: in his silent bow,
 already yawned before the show,
 and empty gossip, you'll allow,
 Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
 to see you, faithfully to follow,
 I only write like this, you know,
 only in January the snow,
 bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
 I've run a mile, I must avow,
 without a goal on which to fix,
 of that old duellistic fox,
 beyond a string of dull tableaux,
 I'd love you, but inside a day,
 and then, indoors the livelong day,
 Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
 the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
 always monotonously gay,
 alarmed by my melodious lay,
 to see life as a ritual play,
 Tatyana's love is no by-play,
 (in the romantic style, we say,
 forgotten features. ``Can you say,
 to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
 to the empty homestead made her way,
 though we... don't shine in any way,
 past ice-blocks, blue and squared away,
 would say goodbye and drive away,
 sequence of dinners stretch away,
 darlings, then we'll run away,
 pretty maidens, romp away,
 Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
 battling along that watery freeway,
 and held him briefly in their sway,
 stiffening as the hours go by,
 We each enjoy a special hobby,
 are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
 but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
 his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
 of children, though as young as they,
 Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
 the cold perfection of the sky,
 to boom, to flash across the sky,
 and there, beneath your noonday sky,
 girls as they passed her spoke less loudly,
 the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
 Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
 is the supreme reward. Precisely,
 across green meadows, dilly-dally,
 and read my Apuleius keenly,
 By now the sun is climbing steeply,
 All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
 to dreaming given up unduly,
 is represented rather truly,
 bright summer days that passed so slowly,
 reluctant to exhaust the boy,
 on features known, but to that dreary,
 bored with hilarity, and weary,
 Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
 all egoistical and dry,
 How long he'd been here, was her query,
 before him roast beef, red and gory,
 I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
 fortune, and dignity, and glory,
 ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
 and p&acirc;t&eacute;, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
 this modish whirl, this social story,
 to high renown my doleful story,
 with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
 where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
 boredom has just as sure an entry,
 Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
 for in our time, beyond dubiety,
 But, did they not corrupt society,
 another's grin was sly and shifty,
 But then, oblivious of the city,
 in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
 the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
 go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
 devote to whist an evening party,
 I've known too many a haughty beauty,
 inexorably wed to duty,
 and taken by the French - some prize! --
 a lady - what a grim discussion! --
 who early died as die the brave'' --
 such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --

 Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine6 --

 in first place - listen, am I right? --
 the darling objects - don't you know it? --
 military-foppish, diplomatic --
 They buzz - but then all talk's suspended --
 the eager players are enrolled --
 and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
 her feelings were far more inclined --
 sweet words by which her pain was banned --
 had with its brilliant mantle crowned --
 with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
 and whist, that's now so keenly f&ecirc;ted --
 while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
 the noise their rustic wheels projected --
 expecting winter, nature waited --
 the headpiece-text is thus indited --
 Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
 till then had been dispersed and wasted --
 the man she feared and idolized --
 beyond the grave we all must build --

 reader, you ask, and I'll expound --

 and always the inspired regard --

 who sets me snoring then and there --
 Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
 the season which is such a bore --
 Of Lensky's fate they said no more --

 Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --

 declares itself in ways unwitting --
 The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
 his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --

 Seeing herself as a creation --

 She struck one as the incarnation --
 finding in that no deprivation --
 with such a blissful, brief infection --
 craving your tolerance in season --
 don't judge the race before it's run --
 would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
 Enough, I tell you, that will do --
 let evening pass, tomorrow too --
 paled, flushed, or lost composure's grip --
 but your vile Helen's not my star --
 perhaps - for flattering hope will linger --
 it's like a vanishing newcomer --
 on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
 simple old lady; but the liquor --
 But the swift summer-time proceeds --
 could have been turned to worthier ends --
 for the bleak tongue of boorish clods --
 sensitive ladies of all ages --
 the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
 Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --
 in Olga everything expresses --
 How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
 ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --
 the ring of marriageable girls --
 the legatee of his relations --
 Such were a young rake's meditations --
 throughout the boredom of the hours --
 or for the modishly luxurious --
 till now our language - proud, God knows --
 and ruled him like an autocrat --
 rigorously though you'd inspect --
 and yet in her you'd not detect --
 across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
 she looks, the room is getting light --
 their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
 that Menelaus was quite right --
 the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
 Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
 my tongue kept drawing from the heart --
 you took an honourable part --
 how well he knew the way to hurt --
 in your cal&egrave;che of foreign cast --
 smile, voice and movements, little waist --
 spared her the expense she dreaded most --
 if her cross mood was at its worst --
 Tatyana struggles to run out --
 she flails around, she tries to shout --
 that one be shot just anyhow --
 he looks, and sees the hour of day --
 that languid beauty, listens nicely --
 It all seemed new - for two days only --
 and she, submissively, inertly --

 Few foreign masterpieces can have suffered more than Eugene Onegin from the English translator's failure to convey anything more than - at best - the literal meaning. It is as if a sound-proof wall separated Pushkin's poetic novel from the English-reading world. There is a whole magic which goes by default: the touching lyrical beauty, the cynical wit of the poem; the psychological insight, the devious narrative skill, the thrilling, compulsive grip of the novel; the tremendous gusto and swing and panache of the whole performance.

 Vladimir Nabokov's rendering into unrhymed iambics reproduces the exact meaning, but explicitly disclaims any further ambition. While Nabokov admits that in losing its rhyme the work loses its ``bloom'' he argues, irrefutably, that no rhyming version can be literally accurate. It can however certainly strive for something else. It can attempt to produce some substitute for the ``bloom'' of the original, without which the work is completely dead. It can try to convey the poet's tone of voice, whether world-weary or romantic, the sparkle of his jokes, the flavour of his epigrams, the snap of his final couplets. None of these effects can emerge from a purely literal unrhymed translation. In fact, to offset the inevitable loss in verbal exactness, a rhyming version can aim at a different sort of accuracy, an equivalence or parallelism conveying, however faintly, the impact of the original.

 Secondly, he must be on his guard against the ludicrous effect that the feminine ending (for instance the pleasure/measure rhyme, which is so much derided by Nabokov) can all too easily produce in English. He must not sing, like Prince Gremin in one English version of Chaykovsky's opera:
 but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
 she finds, in order alphabetic:
 they rise and ripen and fall dead:
 of entertaining the half-dead:
 first snow for shoulders, breast and head:
 the ballroom drove me off my head:
 billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
 in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
 you left no steps that could be tracked:
 and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
 in terms where not a word was spared:
 and nothing in her look is altered:
 on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
 no one was ever so engrossed:
 the thought sank in, and penetrated:
 of light that flowering fields reflected:
 where two old pinetrees stand united:
 ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
 he found too much that he regretted:
 sweet old tradition was preserved:
 by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
 then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
 times were when I was sharp and bold:
 until the grave by your strong hand:
 the letter from Tatyana's hand:
 a hidden beauty in the end:
 and give her comfort to the end:
 you kept your friendship with our friend:
 in any picture of this kind:
 can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
 commands our rhymester-brotherhood:
 out of the hand of that same bard:
 Olga's no life in her regard:
 I really dote upon the word:
 have each asked him to a soir&eacute;e:
 To private tastes we each subscribe:
 the men confront them, face to face:
 too faint to stir a further pace:
 a few books had escaped disgrace:
 was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
 At least I'll give him some advice:
 there was a softness in his glance:
 set to well-known children's glee:
 to be respected all through life:
 how sad the scar of passion's knife:
 The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
 bright Northern Cleopatra she:
 then quietly at last says she:
 will disappear as fast as smoke:
 with this the hero of my tale:
 Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
 found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
 Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
 befitting such a noble pile:
 nothing you did gave cause for blame:
 to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
 I need to rest from all this rhyme:
 the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
 youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
 dreamt of reproving what they'd done:
 lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
 Moscow has beauties and to spare:
 I keep them, and will quote them here:
 is with dull trash that can't cohere:
 Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
 of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
 enough of my loquacious lyre:
 reflection or provoked dispute:
 your early life, unlock your tongue:
 Now hear the friends in dialogue:
 ages we'd never heard of love:
 all was material for transcribing:
 and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
 be good enough to go on reading:
 He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
 bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
 audacious tunnels will be marching:
 calls out his name... All unavailing:
 and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
 I see another problem looming:
 among the guests a general dinning:
 and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
 Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
 He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
 the infant year with cheerful greeting:
 so long as they're employed in song:
 soon all that went without a wrench:
 with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
 held in constraint by pity's touch:
 and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
 Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
 over it a mysterious wreath:
 There once I too strolled back and forth:
 of traveller's tedium at its peak:
 says the old lady in a croak:
 these words are not of Russian stock:
 any Madonna by Van Dyck:
 was an enchanting country nook:
 makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:
 his thoughts were on a distant goal:
 then from the Muse there came revival:
 and sink to prose's humble level:
 enquired the lady of the hall:
 from the agent, with this tale to tell:
 But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
 I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
 But ever stranger and more fearful:
 Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
 at sunken wax inside a bowl:
 untirable, at sound of drum:
 You've guessed before it all began:
 and even honourable man:
 Up to the porch our hero's driven:
 the rogue has got a finger frozen:
 yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
 Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
 excited not a hint of passion:
 gives way to nature's normal passion:
 My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
 how I interpret this expression:
 with every sort of home possession:
 hell's terrifying imprecation:
 Sign of the urge for domination:
 he read, and read - no satisfaction:
 had long proved tedious to distraction:
 I gave no rein to sweet affection:
 Another page of recollection:
 The Larins kept the old tradition:
 Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
 then, on the last page, the suggestion:
 On the first sheet you'll find a question:
 to demonstrate some signs of reason:
 her heart had long been overrun:
 and roused the village long ago:
 the wine-addict adores the cup:
 at the same moment in her ear:
 so Lensky answered the old dear:
 She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
 they talk of her, of how and whether:
 while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
 Conjecture found unending matter:
 No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
 with tears, in quarters of the maids:
 The protocol is all one wishes:
 (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
 the prince looks at him, and replies:
 Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
 then quickly something changed all this:
 then, help me God, she caterwauls:
 the funeral monument explains:
 jaws masticate as minutes pass:
 feeling to what had long been heartless:
 but Eugene's out from din and press:
 they all still keep their old impress:
 And with a smile the world caressed us:
 those monkeys of the good old days:
 will blossom into splendid highways:
 gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
 objective of his thoughts and joys:
 on me, all this has no effect:
 a simple Russian family night:
 you're sure to find her portrait in it:
 in your pursuit I've come to know it:
 Listen to me without resentment:
 to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
 Olinka and her mother sent:
 active, and hopeful, and insistent:
 I acted thoughtlessly or not:
 I've paid my due to classic art:
 despite herself, rehearsed the part:
 and should have played a different part:
 about what's buried in the past:
 in other things you come off best:
 when he arrived; not in the slightest:
 spoke words of hope? But who are you:
 with each nuance of wintry glow:
 I'd still like dances to this day:
 praised his fierce courage in its day:
 at my famed portrait and will say:
 like a sweet child. She'll never say:
 But you're not sociable, they say:
 explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:
 his hours to dreaming them away:
 each of us has his favourite lobby:
 ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
 on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
 in unison repeat the cry:
 but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
 in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
 there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
 That isn't our immediate worry:
 is this - one sees from here the party:
 Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
 and, under, ``toute &agrave; vous Annette'';
 when we begin to talk of verse);
 (my tale's beginning here repeats);
 in Adam Smith was his diploma;
 Buy&aacute;nov whirls off Pustyakova;
 I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
 Eugene's response was automatic;
 of spring he lives, he's energetic;
 no deathless truths, nothing scholastic;
 the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
 Lel6 floats about above her head;
 rapture was just two weeks ahead;
 on the dull life that bachelors lead;
 before the fire a table's spread;
 to drive the swooning senses mad;
 and heartless pleasure was up-graded;
 he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
 High ceilings everywhere abounded;
 By chance those verses haven't vanished;
 he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
 Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
 beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;
 in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
 her manner is no less contained;
 how many follies were engendered;
 if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
 both hearts to blaze had now expired;
 filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
 her hands affectionately pressed;
 they've moved around and been reseated;
 The clock of doom had struck as fated;
 on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
 by deep and shady woods protected;
 the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
 the downy woods are greener-tinted;
 a hundred times afresh distorted;
 the strophe over which I slaved;
 Russian pancakes were always served;
 at thirty, lucratively wed;
 perhaps for fame, he was endowed;
 and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
 and soon will day's bright tune be played;
 while she's from top to toe surveyed;
 had been imposed by winter's hand;
 I feel a small foot in my hand;
 more searching than Chateaubriand;
 with me to see an alien strand;
 and on their marks has made them stand;
 same Pom, same husband to the end;
 his choice could shock or might offend;
 in grief that nothing else could mend;
 Martin Zad&eacute;ka fails to mend;
 unfathomable to the mind;
 she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
 of mind got clarity new-found;
 from Million Street16 came floating round;
 by dreary snowdrifts piled around;
 gazes at all the scene around;
 as it assembles them around;
 close as a shadow on the ground;
 emotion, thought, and magic sound;
 with our poor girl was kind and good;
 and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
 there's not a word she's understood;
 the source's chattering voice is heard;
 and everything is cramped and loud;
 while a mazurka holds the crowd;
 play on the window's frosted lace;
 up the hillside at breakneck pace;
 sigh, and stood up, began to pace;
 fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;
 their joyous way across the ice;
 would launch into self-sacrifice;
 girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;
 conversing in a singsong voice;
 such good and sensible advice;
 from any gentlemanly distance;
 into the tomb's mysterious shade;
 had come to him in field and glade;
 they heap up silver with a spade;
 past the grand ladies, see her glide;
 to help her from the other side;
 since then my heart was wrenched aside;
 Tatyana groaned above the tide;
 that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
 of every funeral far and wide;
 becomes a horse for all to see;
 with demoiselles of riper age;
 not even in her earliest age;
 Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
 is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
 Omens dismayed her with their presage;
 at first she had no heart to range;
 and in her grief seemed fit to die;
 for what's been given us to take;
 bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
 and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
 years back, to call up many a fable;
 who never learnt how dreamers babble;
 who never scorned the social rabble;
 and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
 he laughs - they all begin to chuckle;
 He nods - they start to fuss and truckle;
 foretells for her some wondrous role;
 there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
 allow no rest to you or me;
 that fired his soul, to burn the same;
 self-willed it may be just the same;
 of something vague, some misty clime;
 grew hardened to life's frosty clime;
 from ball to bed behold him come;
 no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;
 sang for the guests above the wine;
 Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
 to infuriate a clumsy foe;
 consequences of hideous woe;
 Pikht&iacute;n, of the Hussars, was here;
 the faces met with everywhere;
 of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
 secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
 the full fruit of her heart's desire;
 jealousy's flame, to light desire;
 I could describe here his attire;
 you were the first ones he forswore;
 his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
 on stage are thumping without cease;
 I never lived or wrote for praise;
 for tempests and for feasts and noise;
 and he was bored with social noise;
 here there's no conscience, here no sense;
 the all&eacute;e to the lake, the copse;
 the horses fidget worse and worse;
 sets out upon her homeward course;
 by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
 were all the law that I would use;
 their unattractive t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te;
 would be allied to him by fate;
 the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
 is tinsel on a life I hate;
 he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
 scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
 from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
 relined and strengthened for the drive;
 in ink with colour-wash above;
 men made their bows, and sought her eye;
 not only by Evgeny's eye;
 and leant upon the granite shelf;
 its furrow through the powdery icing;
 behind her followed wildly dancing;
 Bacchante-like, her flighty prancing;
 while in the hut a girl is singing;
 Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
 and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
 after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
 Then, after midday he'll be waking;
 such is the usual country cooking;
 towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
 when night patrol's a perilous calling;
 Silence was everywhere enthralling;
 to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
 you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
 to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
 shelter for trysts at every turning;
 one wallows in delicious weeping;
 still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
 her golden earrings off and whipping;
 the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
 here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
 to his disputing and his cursing;
 but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
 everything's dim and unenthusing;
 even the scandal's not amusing;
 she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
 he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
 what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
 a story that still wants completing;
 that there his friend Kav&eacute;rin's5 waiting;
 We too shall find our hour is waiting;
 Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
 he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
 and all is lost beyond retrieving;
 lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
 roses romantically blowing;
 his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
 and good old sun more seldom glowing;
 Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
 it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
 dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
 and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
 neighbours in high content are wheezing;
 the Russian N, like N in French;
 once I too liked it very much;
 a portrait with a charming touch;
 breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
 impatient, hatred flaming high;
 and offer to that ash a sigh;
 the bloom has withered on the bough;
 choked up. There's no wreath on the bough;
 and arm in arm they all go through;
 I count each hour the whole day through;
 Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
 accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
 towards the simple urn beneath;
 bringing her unity and strength;
 only to Eugene showed their worth;
 parodies winter in the south;
 nanny, companion of my youth;
 a crayfish rides on spider-back;
 and swaggers in a red calpack;
 the branches of the oak with flock;
 across the fields, round hill and rock;
 the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
 even without me it will sink;
 by Lensky in his Olga's book;
 more closely at the grammar-book;
 by ancient limes, or by a brook;
 the cooks prepare the midday meal;
 of other's thought - a splendid goal;
 I find myself no longer equal;
 my soul in secret gave survival;
 had killed his best friend in a duel;
 was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
 I have no leisure to recall;
 shall make my story grim as hell;
 he trembles, knows not what to tell;
 he reached the stream below the hill;
 at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
 he scowls - and the whole gang are still;
 no word came flowing from his quill;
 engaged then - but against her will;
 he drinks - all shout and take a swill;
 that wit embarrasses the dull;
 to the complacent and the null;
 with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
 in her torn heart - a fickle gleam;
 the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
 has taken on a silvery gleam;
 to spoil loose paper by the ream;
 meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;
 O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
 the shady wood, the talking stream;
 He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
 life's real meaning would have found him;
 already there she stands beside him;
 ``My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
 despite herself, is Lensky's doom;
 far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
 clears in a flash the freezing room;
 claiming Tatyana'd found her man;
 walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
 but now the mansion is forsaken;
 you find the country godforsaken;
 Departure date's long overtaken;
 Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
 comrades despised, and comrades rotten;
 The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
 fat P&uacute;styakov has driven in;
 levy their tribute on the plain;
 in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
 and parts the fringes of his curtain;
 with comedies of swarm and din;
 whose serfs are miserably thin;
 alone, with no adornment on;
 the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
 to battle further with my passion;
 Zaretsky rose without discussion;
 your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
 I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
 dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
 O Adrian waves, my invocation;
 and all our modish education;
 it mastered him in slow gradation;
 rebuffed, found instant consolation;
 Compliment and congratulation;
 And home was now their destination;
 the coach has reached its destination;
 Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
 the universe is all perfection;
 and always the self-same objection;
 is lost in obstinate reflection;
 ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
 The flirt has reason's cool volition;
 I'm blind to every apparition;
 a truly noble disposition;
 she drinks it like a priceless potion;
 and it deceived us in return;
 as battles go, I've not begun;
 from daybreak valleys lift the sun;
 in the full beauty of its frown;
 the latest fashions of the town;
 I married. I beseech you, go;
 she flies as fast as she can go;
 thought them a pointless peccadillo;
 her handkerchief has fallen too;
 but spared no glance for Cicero;
 that night, in secret, set for two;
 over the waters in a sweep;
 the letter trembles in her grip;
 here's Petushk&oacute;v, the local fop;
 delicious novels, laps them up;
 in his defence, and smash it up;
 wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
 with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
 the talk of guests when they appear;
 and Dunya works the samovar;
 comes for awakening, comes for slumber;
 I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
 and from within come noise and cheer;
 A backward look is fraught with danger;
 The city's early sounds awake her;
 His life went sailing in calm weather;
 Some neighbours there have come together;
 I'll part them, bring them back together;
 their lords, and thwack their palms together;
 Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
 rendered them tedious to each other;
 No moralizing from this joker;
 faceted muzzles by the rammer;
 he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
 bring up a table, and a taper;
 spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
 find, in the trivial, serious matter;
 with his forefathers would seem better;
 add vale when he signed a letter;
 still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
 glitters beneath its icing-sliver;
 Our love is what they most abhor;
 the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
 from table, clattering on the floor;
 he'd listen to the administrator;
 in corners whispering girls concur;
 by way of toast to their fair neighbour;
 clock in the country rings the hour;
 Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
 its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
 There's powdery snow up to her knees;
 Love tyrannises all the ages;
 the jams appear in little dishes;
 of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
 by any itch for marriage ties;
 of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
 that verse will turn to useful duties;
 brushes on thirty different scales;
 the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
 no one recalls him or his verses;
 the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
 Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
 all sorts of hopeless appetites;
 like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
 that ardent youth entirely lacks;
 to scorn the men with whom he deals;
 and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
 the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
 the snow from all surrounding hills;
 for us are instruments and tools;
 to sleep some black and empty dreams;
 a Russian family's old traditions;
 poor Tanya more intensely burns;
 I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
 on unknown ladies in the tiers;
 printed among outmoded airs;
 adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
 with an avowal just as artless;
 that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
 at least by a regretful kindness;
 that could sustain it? Only grimness;
 bespectacled, in tattered dress;
 the ladies' calculated dress;
 evoke for you a sombre bliss;
 The yard was bursting with dependants;
 culture, so far from healing, hurts us;
 in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;
 the bear has raised her in his paws;
 no move she makes, no breath she draws;
 reap a brief harvest on their furrows;
 right from the cradle of her days;
 and every plea that lips can treat;
 by clearing every sort of debt;
 of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
 and kisses smack as young girls greet;
 on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
 we'll draw it deeper in our net;
 may wind up my career as poet;
 your heels will squash the ladies' toes! &gt;
 all of an emptiness so killing - &gt;
 my word; no welshing, as I live. &gt;
 and good and bad are all mixed up. &gt;
 outside and in they star the night;
 once more he can't await the night;
 the happenings of the previous night;
 still everywhere the lamps are bright;
 and prone to censure in our thought;
 ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;
 from day to day she could but wait;
 with cranium aching fit to split;
 frozen in his tight-fitting suit;
 condemns the monde and its excitement;
 he ended even your employment;
 ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
 and I be by the world forgot;
 husband and father as my lot;
 my life in a domestic plot;
 two pines have tangled at the root;
 shall not attack my lily's root;
 and sat there as the minutes crept;
 the uncertainties within his heart;
 of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
 Tatyana hears but takes no part;
 heaven's will - for you I'm set apart;
 or Russia's chondria, for short;
 by some perverse schoolboy for sport;
 and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
 need not have bristled like a beast;
 now as before, inside my breast;
 to feasts and fun this winter past;
 he danced attendance with the best;
 a life-creating voice was lost;
 to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
 thank him by curtseying to the dust;
 or stirring annalistic must;
 on the highroad the wolves come out;
 a sham that trustful souls work out;
 the sumptuous palais shines out;
 We've many neighbours round about;
 into the social whirlabout;
 do fields echo with work and shout;
 ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
 the household boys in noisy rout;
 ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;
 I'm at your service to protect you;
 She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
 and autumn lingered, long and slow;
 along the street lies dirty snow;
 lived to the age of twenty-six;
 two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
 Onegin had no word to say;
 a shambling hoof along the way;
 with custom, love would fade away;
 an ace a dozen yards away;
 dowagers smiled as she went by;
 Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
 lacing her stays up very tightly;
 is deep in love, just like a boy;
 The two old ladies kiss and cry;
 once more Corneille's majestic story;
 with perturbation and with worry;
 a ball here, there a children's party;
 You'd never class her as a beauty;
 (as I've so oft in jest related)?
 My goddesses! Where are you banished?
 For what charade is he apparelled?
 could it be she... or had he dreamed?
 away, so cool, so unconcerned?
 assembly, silent and dejected?
 lawgiver to the modish world?
 his acts and words to suit our end?
 On whom alone can we depend?
 whither does all my yearning tend?
 Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
 by the new whisper in the wood?
 someone like you and me, just nice?
 and I'll be thirty in a trice?
 with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
 at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
 as I recall a bygone age?
 Riding on the lugubrious prairie?
 a tempting plume for you to take?
 bursts with cold envy and with bile?
 what have your wits to do with me?
 torment of pride? And why's he come?
 to all that's trivial and inane?
 ``How long has he been on the scene?
 a slipper, or a magazine?
 daytimes and evenings passed alone?
 taken your place, though not your throne?
 when shall I start on my escape?
 whom shall we never find a bore?
 is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
 Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
 their table, and their hours of leisure?
 of youth, so tender, so intense?
 from cruel fortune such a fate?
 What trifling could be more complete?
 is this the riddle's missing clue?
 is this then what you can't forgive?
 why fight what's known to be decisive?
 it can't be youth's distemper - love?
 with years no more to meet our gaze?
 Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
 Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
 inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
 is this the man that you were seeking?
 Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
 that strikes him with such force and meaning?
 over the slush, where is he chasing?
 Then what resulted from the meeting?
 Can she have found the enigma's setting?
 ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
 What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
 does he still pose, and play the freak?
 what play will he present this week?
 and sees... whatever do you think?
 or else, my friend, how does it look?
 where can we find your equal?
 in vain on my unworthy soul?
 He wakes - and who is this who writes him?
 Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
 in one so slothful, so hard-bitten?
 her full account of voiceless pain?
 of jealous girls, devote its strain?
 where are distress, commiseration?
 what dream accounts for her distraction?

 In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?

 Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
 a tear for him... but what's to weep?
 my golden days when spring was dear?
 such careless language of surrender?
 ``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?
 When comes my moment to untether?
 fraught with enticement and disaster?
 your chorus, is it dead for ever?
 He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
 or did her grief soon find repair?

 O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?
 Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
 Whose fond attentions will astound us?
 at this betrayal's fateful news?
 that once I spent my happiest days?
 But now! what brings you to my feet?
 again I see your soulful flight?
 ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?

 Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
 down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled

 he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened

 Tanya's no longer quite so frightened

 Who in that flash could not have reckoned
 I had most surely never reckoned

 just as she'd always been, she tripped
 Tatyana went with them, and sped

 Her tender touch had never fingered

 Once home, he brought out and inspected
 Often of course you'll have inspected

 But my Eugene that night directed

 there was no trace to be detected
 Thronged by adorers, I've detected

 No path to see: the snow has drifted

 And suddenly her radiance lighted
 He was too young to have been blighted
 Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted

 Yet - fear itself she found presented

 Outside the gate Tatyana parted

 Between them, every topic started

 Now for the first time she's escorted
 Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
 jealously, shyly, I've imported
 which smilingly your friend, supported
 She was like him and always sported
 but, without asking, they transported
 Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
 With reason, too: for when he'd vetted

 before the clavichord with knitted

 a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed

 and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
 he's lost his self-command, and crazed
 among the guests she recognized
 the lucky bard, and as he dozed

 Her eyes were opened, and she said

 Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid

 The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of French and other foreign words, but of slang and of audacious Byronic-type rhymes. If the translator produces nothing comparable, he is emasculating his original. If he attempts to follow suit, he must do all he can to avoid the pitfalls of the embarrassing, the facetious and the arch. {29}
